# Art-Style-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Project
Final Project for Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals
•	Developed a classification model in Python to predict the style of unseen portrait artworks
•	Utilized VGG16 as feature extractor with Convolutional Neural Networks to capture and learn unique characteristics from Expressionism, Impressionism, Romanticism, and Realism class in 4700+ paintings; Achieved a testing accuracy of 0.64 in out-of-sample data
